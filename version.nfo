/*  Dragon Slayer v.âˆž+1 zetha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	For now the game is far from being a game. The player choose a character. Based on a random math funtion player hits the Dragon
	until the Dragon dies and game is over. It is only a bunch of message boxes on which you click ok, ok, ok, ok and the game is over.

	If you have read the README file already, you know its primary focus is to learn the language so please do not hesitate to send
	your comments or bug reports as well as your tips, hints and/or suggestions about the JavaScript Language. It is very much 
	appreciated.
