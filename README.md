    About the project: 

    First of all I would like to state that this project is aimed to be learning tool for javascript language. I started this project 
    with no knowlegde of language or experience at all. I'm hoping to learn the language through this project. The code will b released
    on git repos so that anyone who would like to contribute and/or give more insights about the language or the game itself is more 
    than welcome. I hope you enjoy it! 

    About the game(coding):

    This is a javasript text based rpg game. The first stage of the game will be hard-coding of the game in javascript which works only 
    through browser console and message boxes. Once we achieve a bug free stable version of the game, on the second stage we are hoping 
    make it more interactive on the gameplay side; such like a console embedded into a web page through which we type the commands and 
    go through the game. The third stage of the game - hopefully f we can make this far - will be perfecting the game, adding more 
    characters, more enemies and more levels. This is the very basic idea of the game, though

    About the game(gameplay):

    The basic game structure for the game will be similar to any RPG games. The player will choose among the charachters to play and
    based on his/her choice weapons will be presented. There will be an imaginary map where the player wander and fight agains the 
    enemies. Enemies also varies on size (well, imagine..) and power. There will b power-ups and new items player can collect and use.
    A fully working text based interactive multiplayer RPG hopefully will be the end result

    We would prefer our target audience to be enthusiastic about programming and no more above the medium level on javascript language for
    the first stage of the game - In the future who knows.. - as we would like to learn the language through this game.
